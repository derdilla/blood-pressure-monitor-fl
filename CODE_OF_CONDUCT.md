# Code of conduct

As a basis for working together every community member, sponsor, or maintainer has to agree to following these following basic principles in all interaction related to this project or its users.

1. Respect each other as human beings
2. Don't participate in unrelated discussions like politics or personal differences
3. Follow all applying laws
4. Act in the best interest of the apps users

This code of conduct explicitly encourages taking controversial stands on technical topics, as these improve the resulting solutions.

Violating these basic rules, especially if done repeatedly or deliberately, _will_ result in exclusion from discussions and/or contributions.

Anyone can privately raise concerns by sending an email to [contact@derdilla.com](mailto://contact@derdilla.com).
