# Supported Bluetooth devices

In general any device that supports [`Blood Pressure Service (0x1810)`](https://bitbucket.org/bluetooth-SIG/public/src/main/assigned_numbers/uuids/service_uuids.yaml#lines-77:79) could be used. The blood pressure measurement values are stored in the characteristic [`Blood Pressure Measurement (0x2A35)`](https://bitbucket.org/bluetooth-SIG/public/src/main/assigned_numbers/uuids/characteristic_uuids.yaml#lines-161:163)

## Reading caveats

There are some difference in how devices report their measurements.

Most devices provide 2 ways to retrieve measurements over bluetooth, but there are also difference in how those operate:

1. Immediately after taking a measurement
    1. and returns all measurements stored in memory
    2. and only returns the latest measurement
2. As a download mode
    1. and automatically remove all locally stored measurements after a succesful download
    2. and leave measurements untouched, i.e. the user needs to remove the stored measurements themselves

> ⚠️ At the moment situation 2.i is not well supported. Do not use this unless you are ok with loosing previously stored measurements
