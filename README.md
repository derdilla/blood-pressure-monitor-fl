## Installation

Currently, the app is only developed for Android, but should be easy to port to other platforms as well.

As there is no demand Windows, Linux and MacOS builds have been stopped. In case you are interested in them feel free to open an issue to indicate that.IOS builds are currently not available as the platform is more restrictive and hard (expensive) to develop for. So I won't take this step unless there is significant demand.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are greatly appreciated and can come in many forms. Please note that when contributing you agree that your work is under the same license as the project.

### Opening bugs and proposing features

This is probably the simplest to do: Use the app and find out what's wrong and what can be improved. There is no such thing as a wrong issue. Just make sure there is no existing one about the exact same topic If you are unsure about something just create a new issue, the worst thing to happen is that it gets closed.

### Improving texts and translating
Another easy way to help is to go through the texts (this one or the ones in the app) and fix grammar/other mistakes or find better (more precise/friendly) ways to put things.
The easiest way to do this is [weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/blood-pressure-monitor-fl/).

### Pull requests
If you can code, you can fix issues or implement features from the issues page. While not a strict requirement, it is recommended to talk about it in an issue first.

All parts of the code have extensive documentation and some additional information can be found in the [docs](https://github.com/NobodyForNothing/blood-pressure-monitor-fl/tree/main/docs) folder.
